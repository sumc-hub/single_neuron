# single_neuron

This repository contains the code for a single neuron implemented in Python. I developed this project while learning the basics of deep learning. The motivation behind this project was to gain a practical understanding of neural networks, particularly focusing on single neurons.

## Introduction

A single neuron, also known as a perceptron, is the fundamental building block of neural networks. It takes input data, processes it using weights and biases, and produces an output. Understanding how a single neuron works is crucial for grasping more complex neural network architectures.

## About the Project

This project serves as a practical implementation of a single neuron. By coding this project, I aimed to solidify my understanding of the theoretical concepts I learned from various sources, including tutorials, online courses, and books. In particular, I found 3Blue1Brown's 'Neural Networks' series to be immensely helpful in grasping the basic principles of neural networks.

## Usage

To use this code, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the main script. You can customize the input data, weights, biases, and activation function parameters to observe the behavior of the single neuron.

```python
# This is a Python code block
git clone https://github.com/your-username/single_neuron.git
cd single_neuron
python main.py
```
